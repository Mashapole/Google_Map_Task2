For this task you will need to build a fully working prototype. This prototype needs to include all 
the features listed in the instructions section of this document but based on your own design and 
user interface layout. The app must compile and run for marks to be awarded for the features of 
the app.
Additional features specified in your design document can be deferred until the final POE 
submission. And final assets (for example images) do not need to be included in the prototype.
You must create a demonstration video showing the prototype running in an emulator. For the 
video, make sure that you show the app performing the following functions:
• The user must be able to register using the app. This registration information must be 
stored in an online, hosted authentication service.
• The user must be able to login to the app using a username and password. This information 
must be retrieved from the online authentication service.
• The user must be able to change their settings (which should be stored in an online, hosted 
database) including but not limited to the following:
o Toggle between using the metric system (kilometres) or using the imperial system 
(miles)
o Preferred type of landmark (for example historical, modern, popular)
• The user must be able to view nearby landmarks on a map (use a webservice to obtain this 
information). The map component must be embedded in the app.
• The app must display landmarks filtered according to the preferred type of landmark 
based on the setting chosen by the user.
• The app must display the user’s current position on the map.
• The user must be able select a landmark on the map to get information regarding the
landmark including directions to the landmark.
• The app must then be able to calculate the best route between your current location and 
the landmark. (You can create this algorithm yourself or obtain this information from a 
webservice.)
• The app must display the estimated time and distance to the destination
• The app must display the distance to the destination in kilometres or miles, depending on 
the setting chosen by the user.
• The app must also display this route visually (on the embedded map).
• The user must be able to store a list of favourite landmarks which gets saved to the 
database.
The demonstration video must effectively demonstrate all the features of the app and be fully 
professional. The video must include a voice over explaining what you are showing. The video must 
also show what data is stored in the online hosted authentication service and database.
The app must have a user friendly and appropriate user interface, that is able to handle invalid
inputs made by the user without crashing. The app must be working with only minor bugs and 
errors.
Submit the following:
• A zipped copy of your source code.
• Demonstration video
